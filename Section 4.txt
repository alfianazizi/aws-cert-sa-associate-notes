    Section 4: AWS Simple Storage System (S3)
-----------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------
    4.1: S3 101
-----------------------------------------------------------

What is S3:
  S3 is safe place to store files
  Object Storage type (only metadata store in datacenter)
    object: vieos, photos, etc (flat files)
    block: hardware-like storage for OS or VM
  Data is pread across multiple devices and facilities

Dummies:
  S3 is Object based
  Files can be from 0 - 5 TB in size
  Unlimited Storage
  Files stored in Buckets (like folder)
  S3 name must be unique
  https://s3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<name>
  Return HTTP 200 Response if the upload succeed

Data Consistency:
  Read after write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
    (immediate consistency, able to read immediately after upload new file)
  Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
    (have delay for updating Objects, bcs objects are spreads across facilities)
  Atomic: Only get either new or old data. NOT be able to get partial or corrupted data

Mechanism:
  S3 is Object based. Consist of the following:
    - Key (name of the object)
      Sort object in alphabetical order
      (ex. Log data contains name and time, add random letter in the beginning of object so the object are spread evenly)
    - Value (data made up of a sequence of bytes)
    - Version ID (for versioning)
    - Metadata (data about data (date uploaded the files, etc.))
    - Subresources (eist underneath of object)
      - Access Control List (ACL) : who can access the object
      - Torrent : Support bitTorrent Protocol

Basics:
  - Built for 99.99% availability for S3
  - Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability (SLA)
  - Amazon Guarantee 11x9's durability
  - Tiered Storage
  - Lifecycle Management
  - Versioning
  - Encryption
  - Secure data using ACL and Bucket Policies

Storage Tier/Classes:
  S3
    - 99.99% availability
    - 99.999999999% durability
    - stored redundantly, sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently

  S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed)
    - For data which accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed
    - Minimum Storage duration 30days

  RRS(Reduced Redundancy Storage)
    - 99.99% durability
    - 99.99% availability
    - 1 concurently facility fault tolerant

  Glacier
    - Used for archival only
    - Takes 3-5 hours to restore data from Glacier
    - Very cheap!
    - $0.01 per gigabytes per month
    - Minimum Storage duration 90days

Charges:
  - Storage (how much data stored)
  - Requests (how many request of data)
  - Storage Management Pricing
    (add task to, ex. for HR, Dev, etc.)
  - Data Transfer Pricing
    (data coming to s3 free, move to another will be charge for replication)
  - Transfer Acceleration
    (fast, easy, and secure transfer between end user and S3 bucket)
    (ex. user in Japan, New zealand but Buckets in London, instead of uploading to bucket, user upload to edge location
     that are much closer to the user, and have networking between edge location and bucket )
